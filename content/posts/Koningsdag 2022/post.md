First King's Day celebrations after the two year pandemic. Saw a few masked people; i'm thankful to them for either being extra careful, or not superspreading.

What else did i see walking around in Utrecht? More than in previous years, i noticed more Orange t-shirts with a joke message on them. Like this:

Saw a young lady urinating, a few meters away from the partying public, next to the canal. I have no problem with "wildplassen" aka "peeing in the wild". As males, we have as many options as there are trees. It can't be that hard to install proper toilets for everyone. 

I did not see many free-to-pee toilets this year. And i couldn't avoid the smell of the "sausage only" toilets (which can accomodate four of them at a time, with almost full privacy, just like your mom).

The municipality also skipped installing temporary garbage bins, it seems. It gets a little tiring to see Heineken cans piled every 50m. I mean, superior beer does exist!

Overall, it was a great excuse to drink three beers in public at 2PM. I think this is what they mean by hobo-chic.
