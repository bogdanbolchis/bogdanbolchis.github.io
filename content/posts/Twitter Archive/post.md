[Twitter is going so great nowadays](https://twitterisgoinggreat.com) that it has become painful to use in a browser. My feed is now crawling with suggested content and creepy ads. I am guessing that Mr. Musk doesn't have the physical time to do all the content moderation himself... Tweetbot and other 3rd party apps are still an option, for now at least.

Still, for these and other reasons, i've decided to deactivate my account. I guess i'll go back to old-fashioned newsletters for the iOS stuff i was reading on Twitter.

Reading tweets sometimes inspired me to write my own. Most of them were jokes but i also posted photos that i wanted to share with the world. I think all that deserves to live here, until something better comes along.
