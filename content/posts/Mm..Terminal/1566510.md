This post is about customising the look of Terminal on macOS. A number of nice themes are included with it (I enjoy Homebrew, among others), and can be selected in Preferences (cmd + comma).

I am a fan of [Nova](https://nova.app), the text editor. It offers four beautiful themes, which i wanted to make available for Terminal. Here they are: [github link](https://github.com/bogdanbolchis/terminal-app-nova-themes).

## Extras

### Colorized output for `ls`

Run `alias ls` to check if an alias already exists for `ls`. If it returns `ls ='ls -G'`, you don't need to continue.

If nothing is returned, you can change the default behaviour of the `ls` command by creating an alias for it: `echo "alias ls='ls -G'" >> ~/.zshrc`. From then on, `ls` will mean `ls -G` (the "-G" option means "enable colorized output"). Reload your terminal profile to updated the configured aliases: `source ~/.zshrc`.

For troubleshooting, see [this stackexchange q&a](https://apple.stackexchange.com/q/33677).

### Custom prompt
The prompt is the part that comes before the blinking cursor on the command line.

- do `echo $PS1` to output current settings. Result could be: `%n@%m %1~ %# `, where:
	- `%n` stands for the current username
	- `%m` stands for the computer's name, etc.
	- see (this page)[https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Prompt-Expansion.html#:%7E:text=The%20full%20machine%20hostname] for more on "prompt sequences" 
- surround each element like `%n` with `%F{1}` on the left and `%f` on the right (you should replace `1` with a colour code from 0 to 15):
	- `export PS1="%F{1}%n%f@%F{2}%m%f %F{3}%1~%f %F{4}%#%f "`

Move the mouse pointer over the ANSI Colours pickers, to see colours 0 thru 15:
