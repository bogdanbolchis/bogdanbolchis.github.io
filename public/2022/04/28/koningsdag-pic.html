What else did i see walking around in Utrecht? More than in previous years, i noticed more Orange t-shirts with a joke message on them. Like this:
Saw a young lady urinating, a few meters away from the partying public, next to the canal."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:title" content="Koningsdag 2022 in Utrecht"><meta property="og:description" content="First King&rsquo;s Day celebrations after the two year pandemic.

I have no problem with &ldquo;wildplassen&rdquo; aka &ldquo;peeing in the wild&rdquo;. As males, we have as many options as there are trees. It can&rsquo;t be that hard to install proper toilets for everyone.</p><p>I did not see many free-to-pee toilets this year. And i couldn&rsquo;t avoid the smell of the &ldquo;sausage only&rdquo; toilets (which can accomodate four of them at a time, with almost full privacy, just like your mom).</p><p>The municipality also skipped installing temporary garbage bins, it seems. It gets a little tiring to see Heineken cans piled every 50m. I mean, superior beer does exist!</p><p><img src=/f16031ba58.jpg alt="Terminal screenshot with various fonts"></p><p>Overall, it was a great excuse to drink three beers in public at 2PM. I think this is what they mean by hobo-chic.</p><p><img src=/0ae79a9048.jpg alt="Terminal screenshot with various fonts"></p></section><div class=post-tags></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex></div><div class=footer-info>2022 <a href=https://github.com/athul/archie>Archie Theme</a> | Built with <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></div></footer></div></body></html>
